Implement:

PORTS:
 ARM
 m68k port (NeXT slab)
 mips port (SGI Indy)
 sparc v9 port
 sparc v8 port
 alpha port (DEC Multia)
dreamcast drivers:
 cdrom
 rtl8139
sh4 cache enable - dreamcast
statistic gathering:
 process
 thread
 VM
process environment variables
scheduler updates:
 better quantum handling
 priority boost on sem block
improved kernel debugger support:
 better symbol lookup
 disassembly
kernel slab allocator
vfs:
 vnode caching
 getcwd
 attributes
 detach close/freecookie
VM:
 cache layer
 better region creation args (range of virtual addresses, etc)
 reserve regions
 swap
 page out
Improved bus managers (BeOS style)
Fully relocatable kernel, stage2 relocates
disk based filesystem
 FAT
 native
RLD
 lazy binding
 so initialization
 dl_open() et load_addon()
IDE bus manager
net:
 dns lookup
bootmaker improvements (remove config.ini, slurp from directory)
better kernel ASSERTS
improved module bootup calls (int_module(ka, initialization level))
system info syscall, centralize storage
better solution for user space heap growth
IO manager
 block devices register with this, /dev node for user space only?
network driver register with stack directly?
 improve network stack -> nic interaction

In Progress:

ppc port (mac, pegasos)
nfs
GUI

Finish:

use fxsave instead of fsave where appropriate

Fix:

Random reboot on heavy fibo usage
SH-4 ELF relocation
tty - entering too long a line hangs read
fix network drivers to detect multiple cards
 rtl8139
 pcnet32
