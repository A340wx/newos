This driver is by default in the build, but not actually used. It is not very
much tested yet, and there are discussions about rewriting it from scratch,
using other IDE specs/sources to get a stable driver.

So, if you're doing filesystem drivers, it may be interesting to enable this on your
_test_ system, just to see if you can mount your filesystem. But please be aware
that this could scramble up the contents of that harddisk, so please don't use
it if you've got any critical data on a disk in the system you're going to test on.

This driver may be completely rewritten in the future, so don't spent to much
time on testing it, or fixing it.... use it to test _your_ fs driver!
